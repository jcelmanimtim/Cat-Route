# Cat-Route

The cat is hungry, look for a place with lots of food. The game has a map with 5 locations, each location has its description and food inside the place. Explore the history of each location as you search for food. 

Your location will be randomized by the system, and each location has its distance per meter (10-100). You will be asked to enter the area to which you want to visit, and the system will print out every possible route together with the location along with the time duration and distance per meter. The shortest route to get you to your destination will also be recommended by the system.
